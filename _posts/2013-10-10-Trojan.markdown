My Outside prediction for the 22nd

Lots of coverage has gone to predictions as to what will be the specs of the new iPads, well all know Mavericks will be launched but what else will happed?

I predict the AppleTV will recieve a new controlled, and an App Store. 

My Prediction is based on the fact that ios7 for the iPhone  recieved an API for third party controllers with buttons for game playing. I think that this market is very small and not one that would interest apple sufficiently if it wernt a trojan hourse for the apple tv games controller. This will allow for the creation of a ready made libary of games compatible with the apple TV to be created without telling all the developers 'Hey wer're making the Apple TV into a games console' and ruining the secret.

The only reason at the moment I can see why games are not native on the apple tv is that the controller sucks.

The apple tv uses the same processor and the same operating system (ios). It just has different inputs and outputs It goes out to a tv not a touch sensative screen, it is controlled by simple Infra red remote.
The apple tv already includes bluetooth support for keyboards so the only missing piece in the gaming puzzle is a games controller.

The apple tv has slowly built up sales momentum though far lacking behind the phones and tablets, this will push it from being a hobby to a gold mine. The micro console is a new and expanding market which has seen interest from Sony with the Vita TV, Nintendo with the Will Mini, Ouya the new kid on the block who opened up this new market.

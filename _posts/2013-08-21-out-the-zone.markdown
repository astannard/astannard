Developing is what I do enjoy and I am good at, but what do you learn doing what you know how to do? You can improve,  learn new languages and techniques but sometimes it's good to learn whole new skills in whole different areas. That is why I have chosen to give a presentation at Second Wednesday. I have never given a presentation at an event and to be honest I can easily count on one hand the number of powerpoint presentations I have put together.

Inspireced **[James Young][young]** who gave a talk at Septembers **[Second Wednesday][wednesday]** on giving talks. He asked the question

>  What would you rather do than than give a talk in public?

Well giving a public talk is one of the things I least want to do and something that I will find scarry, but I've done plents of scray things and they always seem to work out well in the end and more often than not enjoyable.   

Having the intention to do a talk comes the thought of what to talk about, and then I though about, what do I want to get from the talk. Some people give talks to promote their business, some people give talks to promote themselves and their consultancy business, some people give talks as they are paid to. So why am I talking since none of the above apply to me? Well I guess the thing to do is to talk about something I am excited and enthusiasitc about and hope some of that rubs off on the audiance.

I want to talk about Startup Events, they are a great learning tool and encourage fast paced thinking, teamwork, action and ..
I had been wanting to attend on of these events for a while but none took place anywhere near the East Midlands that I could attend. So I attened a London Launch 48 event and it was one of most tiring and inspiring events I have attended.

Fortunatley these events are now coming to Nottingham with a **[Launch 48][launch]** taking place in October and I am booked in for a **[Startup Weekend][startup]** this November. The first event was attened by lots of business people and not many designers or developers. Design is key to any successfull business, designing the Processes, the Experience, the Look of a business is the key to its success. I want to help encorage people that it is relevant to them and its enjoyable and get a diverse range of people attending and collabarating. Hopefully we will see some new business take off in Nottingham too.
